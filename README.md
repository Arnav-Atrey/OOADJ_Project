Created an inventory management system project using Java.

MVC architecture pattern is used. The Model represents the data and business logic, interacting with the database through classes like User, Customer, Sale, and Billing. Views are created using FXML files to define the user interface, while controllers handle user input and update the model and view accordingly. This structure organizes the codebase, making it easier to maintain, extend, and collaborate on. 

To install all the dependencies: mvn clean install

To start application using mvn command: mvn compile exec:java
